"Woke" was a term originally introduced in African-American English, and gained popularity in 2014 in the light of the Black Lives Matter Movement https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/woke-meaning-origin. It has been used to describing awareness of structural social disadvantages, including racism. The Mirriam-Webster article above writes “_Stay woke_ became a watch word in parts of the black community for those who were self-aware, questioning the dominant paradigm and striving for something better”. Since then, the term got adopted by other social justice advocates to raise awareness of such structural disadvantages, and to call on others to also stay woke. However, this has recently been seized on by right-wing commentators and is said with a negative connotation, where woke people are as “overly sensitive to idealistic causes with a lack of understanding of reality”.

This co-option of “Woke”, has drifted negative to such an extent that simply saying that someone is “Woke” provides a pretext for dismissing a person and their views. This is borderline bullying, in the sense that it is criticism by labelling someone as part of a category without providing the more meaningful content behind that criticism. Unfortunately, this sort of political slandering is nothing new. Previous iterations include “Dirty Hippies”, “Political Correctness/PC Gone Mad”-style headlines. It is no accident that this is in part generational as well, there has been concerted campaigns to make sweeping generalisations about Millenials. It appears that media has sought to cast millennials as ungrateful, self-serving, overly-idealistic, and other such denigrating remarks. Here we see some of these adjectives share some commonalities with criticisms that someone is “Woke”. The fact that younger people tend to me more progressive too allows some generational differences and annoyances to be alluded to or mixed in with polemical outrage against the lack of cooperation from, say, a certain person, group of people, or organisation to toe the line according to the critic’s social expectations.

So we need to unpack the actual meaning of “woke” and see if indeed the complaints of people who are being labelled negatively as woke are 1. in fact legitimate, and 2. What action if any is to be done in light of these social disadvantages. 

To return to what conservative critics of progessive complaints might mean, a woke person is someone who is overly sensitive or too idealistic.

It should be noted that these claims are based on the beliefs about what one _ought_ to be affected by psychologically, in the first case, and in the second case it is based off the concept of what possible alternatives there are.

* 1. People claim these comments/ or this sponsorship deal (for example) offends their identity
* iia. It cannot be meaningful to have one's identity affected based off comments/sponsorship alone OR
* iib. If it _does_ affect their identity, the problem is their own psychological weakness than the comments themselves
* 3. One ought not object to something that doesn't meaningfully affect your identity, or one ought not to criticise other people's comments when the fault is really their own psychological weaknesses
* Therefore, those who are affected by this are not justified in objecting to it

I think two responses might be made to this, first that woke people aren't just concerned about the psychological impact that these comments make in the conception of themself, but also that allowing such commnts/sponsorship to go unchallenged reproduces poor treatment of this group of which the peson is a member. Hence it would be harmful to the group as a whole to allow it to stand unchallenged.

The second response is to say that it's *definitely* meaningful to have one's identity affected by comments or sponsorship, since that these comments are an instance of systematic dismissal of  that group of people, or the group's poor treatment in general.

A respnse to this a response may be "but how do you know that this is really part of poor treatment in general, couldn't it be just a particular instance that can shrug off?". Here there are some good reasons why they don't or shouldn't and I don't believe those who tend to be skeptical about structural disadvantage. This is simply because it is very easy to see how epistemic biases could create ignorance of such structural disadvantage. For example, suppose you believe there is no general discrimination against group X. This fact itself means it is likely you would not see any case where group X is being discriminated against, even if it were to happen because you are not aware of it. And because you have not seen it happen, you are not aware of it, therefore it doesn’t happen. Even if it is pointed out, the cause for the behaviour towards that group member could be seen as an individual case study and mean nothing in the scheme of things, but, as we've seen, this is also likely to be due to epistemic bias. So it is very hard for people on the outside-perspective to really see the world the same way as someone who is a member of that disadvantaged category does, since the person in the structurally disadvantaged category has to deal with it very frequently, and has a long history of knowledge about it in various times and places, whereas the person who didn’t grow up in that category doesn’t. I am therefore likely to believe the person who claims structural disadvantage for themselves over the one who claims it foeas

In the former account, we have seen this kind of criticism levelled at the Australian Diamonds netball team after it declined the sponsorship of Gina Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting, due to comments by her father, Lang Hancock, 40 years ago that argued for sterilisation of indigenous people. Most commentators appear to agree that the comments themselves were, and are, horrible and deeply wrong. Also there has been no response from Gina Reinhart herself on the comments from her late father’s comments as far as I am aware. Nevertheless, critics of the player who originally raised the concern, other players who supported this player, and Netball Australia say that “It is biting the hand that feeds it” and it/the player is being overly sensitive, and shouldn’t be worrying about something that happened 40 years ago. This situation has brought criticism of bending to the will of “woke” players. 

In this critique there seems little consideration about the impact these words, and the lack of apology of them, might have on that person. The strategy here is to ignore or belittle the feelings about the parties affected by these words. In the historic context of the poor treatment of indigenous people in Australia, it should be obvious that such comments and lack of apology may be affecting. This lack of social context is present in many critiques of progressive positions and leads to progressive critiques being cashed out as purely irrational, emotional reactions. It is no accident that feelings are negatively mentioned in the title of a popular blog by conservative commentator Ben Shapiro (“Reality doesn’t care about your feelings”). Because the implication is, that progressives sympathetic to these people who make these complaints come to their perspective based purely off emotions, that these emotions aren’t relevant, and that Shapiro’s blog / conservative critics of progressive complaints are on the side of “reality”.

People from this perspective who “don’t see the big deal” with these “woke issues” also come from a perspective that believes that a function of a sportsperson is to play sport and not to represent political causes. The challenging of the status quo and structures of authority is also very challenging for the conservative sentiment and belief in the order of society as itself a social good. The power structures, conservatives believe, keep society effectively functioning and prevent chaos and anarchy. Authority is seen as its own justification – it’s not that the authority was gained legitimately, but, now that it’s there, it should be maintained to ensure predictable patterns of behaviour. “Our lives are like a fiddler on the roof – just a small change could have them falling off” to quote the musical Fiddler on the Roof. So it’s a belief that society if fragile, precious, and ought to be maintained through existing power structures. Any changes may risk social upheaval, therefore why risk it? Haidt also finds that conservatives are intuitively pro-authority, which for Haidt is a fundamental moral intuition, compared to progressives who just don’t have that intuition.

Given the history of the concept of “woke”, it need not be used merely as an insulting term, and those who socially work towards understanding of the structural injustices to historic minority group could reclaim it and use it in the place of “socially aware” as it was used in 2014. There is a vagueness about what being woke actually might demand from us, but awareness of social disadvantage is a good place to start. It is fair enough to consider whether the calls to, say, boycott such-and-and-such a company for a particular reason is realistic or justified. But it cannot be dismissed a priori by just labelling such a call as “woke”. We must actually understand the criticism as much as possible, consider if the criticism may be reasonable given the person’s membership of a group that has suffered social or historical disadvantage, then separately whether the response being demanded by the person is reasonable given this - by which I mean it is both ethically justified given the likely or possible impacts and whether it is indeed feasible to implement). If we do believe that the position is not realistic, let’s say exactly that and make testable predictions about that. Crucially we ought not to dismiss the person’s feelings or position out of hand. There is no need to diminish the experienced disadvantage even if we do see the particular action being taken as unjustified or not realistic. Those who agree with the person also may be doing so because they disagree about whether the demand of the person are really unrealistic or not, or simply showing their solidarity for the structural disadvantage of someone else.
So let’s distinguish between criticising a complaint (which we should probably consider may be a legitimate feeling) and the action being taken in our criticism and avoid using these labels carelessly.
Maybe we don’t like to be told “stay woke”- but perhaps we can consider the possibility of the perspectives of the person who has lived experience of this to understand what difficulties in their lives they have had to experience due to their membership of a social group, and consider perhaps that their community may have suffered more than others currently or historically, and that this is why they are asking us to be on the lookout for language which implicitly (or explicitly) seeks to devalue them.

The deeper question is, why is there a need to insult someone on the internet at all, and it certainly spaks very badly of our species that this is perhaps the common level of discourse on large social media platforms. Unless we unpack what’s going on here we will suffer greatly in having more productive discussions from different perspectives.
