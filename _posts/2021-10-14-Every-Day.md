Every day is the same\
Every Day is different

I Walk\
Look at the clouds!\
I know I will never see them again!\
Not like that.

Nor will I see\
The same trees, nor sky\
The way I see them right now\
The way the light hits it.\
Or even if a part is the same\
The whole combination\
Is completely new

Indeed\
Non-one else\
Has experienced exactly this before

The world is changed.\
_I_ am changed

Same old?\
No.\
Every day is new
