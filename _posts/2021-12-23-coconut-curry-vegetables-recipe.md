**Coconut curry vegetables**\
This is a delicious recipe I always enjoy, it happens to be vegetarian and could be easily be made vegan with using non-dairy margarine.

	7. Add coconut milk, stir well\
	8. Leave to simmer, make cous cous and serve on cous cous when ready\


Cous cous (serves one - scale up proportionally if there are more people, but if cooking for one its better to make a small amount each night than one large batch as it doesn't reheat well)\

	2. Add 1/2 cup of cous cous and turn off the heat and cover\
	3. Leave for 3 mins\
