The greyness of the lightpole\
Is not uniform\
It is mottled with 1000 small variations

The greyness of the city\
Is not uniform\
It is mottled with 1000 small variations, a colour of movement, and the sound of activity

They greyness of life\
Is not uniform\
It is mottled with 1000 small variations\
Each day looks similar\
But if you pay attention, each day is slightly different, creating a tapestry of patterns

Unlike a pole, our lives are not stationary.\
We change, move and turn\
If we walk in one direction, and others move in another toward us, we meet in half the time.

Each meeting is meaningful\
Each non-meeting is meaningful\
The meetings we don't have shape us all\
Alone, you can meet yourself. Your many-selves.\
You can meet an idea, a feeling, or a need

We sometimes need to look for the small differences. Each day I am a little different from the last. Even if I stand still, the earth moves around me, and if I move, so does the world.


### On Writing

Yet if I write, I am not experiencing the thing in that time. Yet I may be reliving it \ 
If I am genuinely experiencing, I am likely not writing. (I am _doing_ and _being_)\ 
Therefore, writing is usually a projection, memory, or an ideal in the mind's eye.\
And not the experience itself

If I write in public, I feel like I am being myself\
This is because I _am_ a writer. And I write abo stuff that strikes me.\
I am engaging in a process of self-discovery, of _world_-discovery - for the moment itself I had a huge bunch of thoughts, feelings and experiences that could not be encapsulated without time and processing\
I am "being-in-the-world"\
I have seen it before as detachment from the world.\
I am am aware that for some, I am playing the role of _The Poet_, the bohemian.\
Yet it is not because I want to be seen like that - but because it is who I am, and it shows a side of me that is personal yet the others don't know what is being written.
I like tht sense of mystery\/

When observed, we can be tempted to change, conforming, _collapsing_ into one form of being or another.\
The consciousness who observes the world is conscious of the consciousness of me.\
I, too, am aware of their attention\
But I am not captured by their attnetion

Writing is a physical act. It is more concrete than thinking or reflection without that action. It's a practical way to encounter and process experiences\
Our bodies are just as important, alive beings, pulsing systems of movement within us.\
I can say that _**I**_ would not be here without it.
