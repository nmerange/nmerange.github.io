There are several promising democracy reforms being developed at the moment, some based on technology while some are not. This is not a comprehensive list, but rather an overview of the most significant efforts I'm aware of after being exposed to several as part of [Designing Open Democracy](www.designingopendemocracy.com). The descriptions, evaluations and summaries here are rough and open to further revision, readers are encouraged to provide suggestions as to what things should be included and excluded in the following summaries or how I might consider adjusting my evaluations and why. 

The primary goal here is to provide a rough evaluation of these interventions, their relative strengths and weaknesses in comparison to each other and our existing democracy according to certain criteria of what we're after in a good democratic system. The following comprises a list of interventions I'll be considering here.

### Democracy Reforms Being Considered
**Tech-based reforms:**
* [Mivote](https://www.mivote.org.au/what_is)
* [Flux](https://voteflux.org/)
* [Online Direct Democracy](https://www.onlinedirectdemocracy.org/)

**Non-Tech Based reforms:**
* [Citizens' Juries](https://www.newdemocracy.com.au/library/what-is-a-citizens-jury)

**Other reforms not being considered:**
* Voting Machines
* Discussion platforms, such as kialo, argumen, polity, pol.is, etc.
* GILT/Prediki's Proposal for a citizen parliament plus some sort of prediction-making ranking system to see who is providing accurate predictions of what's going on to sort information. This isn't being included due to the lack of familiarity with the system
* NewVote's proposal, as I am not familiar enough with what it entails, suffice to say it has a mixture of things involved - upvoting/downvoting comments to sort information, use of pol.is's system of idea grouping, and some other stuff
* Groups or reforms that I essentially see as more incremental, such as reforms increasing transparency, openness in decision-making, or increasing ease of access to legislators. These reforms may be worthwhile, but likely would not make a significant impact, or would be made redundant if a new system was adopted. These reforms will be more useful the less user-friendly the government decision-making process is.

In principle, any intervention could be assessed using the following criteria. However, it is important to consider which criteria are appropriate and why; we should not necessarily aim for an intervention that does everything, but perhaps a series of interventions that can specialise in certain areas. The most important part of any system though is who gets decision-making power, and how does this manifest?

### Summary of Interventions Being Considered

#### [Mivote](https://www.mivote.org.au/what_is)

Issue-Based information aggregation and informed voting software

How does it work?
* Via app, person opts in/opts out of question being discussed
* Presents information on a topic, say, housing, along with different frameworks for understanding the topic
* After noting that the person has read some info on the topic (the 'information pack' provided), it gives at least 4 different 'policy approaches' to an issue that could plausibly be taken, person voting picks one

#### [Flux](https://voteflux.org/about/how/)

Issue-Based Liquid Democracy with tweaks

How does it work?
* Each bill in parliament is given a chance to be voted on (In future, it is likely to be possible for people to create the own bills, with votes available for each of those)
* Can choose to give your vote to someone else who votes on your behalf, and you can take back your delegation at any time
* Can choose to not vote, and instead gain political capital that can be spent later on future votes (How much political capital can be saved, whether it becomes less valuable, and if so over what period is something unresolved right now as far as I can tell)
* Plan to implement a system for bidding for political capital, where suppply/demand of political capital on a particular vote determines the value of each political capital - the more people are bidding for tokens, the lower the value of each token used, and the higher value given for saving tokens

#### [Online Direct Democracy](https://www.onlinedirectdemocracy.org/how-the-party-works/)

Direct Democracy

* Each bill is voted on, for/against
* People able to propose their own bills, which are in turn voted on
* Online Direct Democracy Reps vote with majority view from votes
* Initial bills can be agreed on in principle, then worked out further later on
* Pros and cons of each bill can be given 

#### [Citizens Juries](https://www.newdemocracy.com.au/library/what-is-a-citizens-jury)

According to [NewDemocracy](https://www.newdemocracy.com.au/library/what-is-a-citizens-jury), "a Citizensâ€™ Jury is a group of randomly selected members of a community convened to consider a given topic and provide a response or recommendation to the governing body".

Normally, there is a power to call expert witnesses for testimony, engage in group deliberation and discussion on the basis of information presented, and arrives at a majority viewpoint for how to address a particular issue. In NewDemocracy case it's 80%.

Crucial to this is defining the topic given.

## Evaluating Democracy Reform Proposals

Any evaluation of the merits of democracy reform has to be based on what we see as valuable in democracy itself. Without getting into deep philosophical discussion of this here, I will put forth the major principles I think most people would see as valuable and important for democratic decision-making.

#### Priciples underlying Evaluation Criteria - What should good government seek to do?

There are several aspects of Democratic decision-making that are considered valuable:
* Effectiveness
    * Will we get better decisions? (Whether better public policy on the existing information available gets produced, however that's defined. e.g. Does it help us solve problems in the best way, deal with the biggest challenges facing us, and generally make excellent decisions?
    * How well will it respond to crises?
* Freedom 
    * To decide who to vote for or the policy involved
    * To decide what issues matter
* Fairness
    * Each person gets one vote
    * Each person's vote is counted and given equal weight
* Transparency
    * Reasoning transparency - people can see why policy X was adopted
    * Procedural transparency - people can in principle have access to the system process and see what happened at each stage (e.g. when did my representative vote on issue X and how did they vote)
* Participation and Inclusion
    * I want to feel like my values, needs, interests or preferences can be appropriately considered
    - Each person has a chance to contribute to decision-making
    - Minorities aren't crushed, nor are they given inappropriate levels of power
* Security and privacy
    * Vote isn't interfered with 
    * Anonymity is assured
    * Not vulnerable to corruption
 
#### Evaluation

Based off these principles, and preceding discussions about creating criteria to determine the value of differing democracy interventions, a list of criteria were created to evaluate democracy reforms. Each intervention was rated out of 10 in each criterion, with a score of 5/10 given for existing Australian Democracy. Thus a score of 5 means that the reform scores about the same on that criterion as existing democracy, with 10 being 'a lot more' than Australian democracy, and 0 being a lot less.

This is to help evaluate the comparative advantage (and disadvantage) of the proposals relative to some reference point that made sense to people. No reform has to be perfect, it just has to be better than what we have. The ratings are rough and plausible, should make comparative sense.

**Evaluation of Democracy Proposals**

Criteria|Existing Democracy (Australia)|Mivote|Flux|Online Direct Democracy|Citizens' Juries
---|---|---|---|---|---
Will we get get better decisions?|5|6.5 (Probably, 65% confident)|5 (Highly uncertain)|2 (I think it's very unlikely, only 20% confident|8(Effective already, highly (80%) confident)
Responsive to crises?|5|4|6|7|2
Protection from vote fraud and tampering|5|9|9|3|6
Vulnerability to corruption|5|6|7|6|4
Overall Security|5|6.5|6|3.5|6
Will it crush minorities?|5|6|3|7.5|6
Involvement of population in setting issues to be decided|5|3|8|8|3
Everyone's perspective is included|5|6|5|7|1
Transparency|5|5|4|6|4
Works at a large scale|5|5|7|10|2
Resources required to run|5|4|3|2|4

Things to note:
* Citizens' Juries have the biggest variation in scores - very effective decisions made, but lack scalability and representativeness
* High level of uncertainty on whether Flux and Mivote will get better decisions - Mivote at least unlikely to be worse than existing Democratic decision-making (I don't think existing decision-making is that bad, but policy frames mean that better approaches can be adopted. Only system that explicitly builds in policy and research feed-in)
* Even though Flux and MiVote are well built to avoid vote tampering through use of blockchain, I don't know if they're both immune to corruption, firstly in the case of MiVote having a small group that set the questions/issues. Flux's tradable political tokens that can be saved with votes that can be delegated is potentially a recipe for vote-buying or bribing apathetic or greedy voters.

Major difference I see between Flux and Mivote based off this analysis is that Mivote is a "safer bet" for better and more integrated policy than Flux, whereas Flux is better for getting people what they feel is important to them and their needs represented, at the cost of policy coherence.

#### What to do with this information?

This was an interesting exercise, but what are we to do with this analysis? The first thought that comes to mind is to determine the relative strengths, but what if we were to be interested in investing philanthropic money in this space?

If someone were interested, this would be the key questions you'd need to answer:
* What key uncertainties about the reform we could resolve through experimentation
* Which reform looks most promising overall? e.g. What could have the most positive impact if implemented well?
* What projects are ready to begin right now?
    * How much would they cost?
* What existing information do we have about what these projects have done already?
* What are the social costs of failure? 

Such a project could be funded based on a need for systemic change, or could be simulated via a game. Democracy 3 is a game that alreasy attempts to show the influence of decisions on social impacts, so it could be based on that idea, but with a different voting system.

Overall, there is a lack of academic rigour applied to effectively assess these interventions, so, of course, good research and structured exploration and experimentation across these interventions could help resolve some of these uncertainties, most importantly to limit the possibility that the system would contribute to catastrophic risks.
