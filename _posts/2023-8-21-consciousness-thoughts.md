Is "consciousness"any more than the aggregated input of different sensations and feelings? Like notes on a staff; play one, and it might not amount to much, but if these sensations harmonise and are multiple, then the experience becomes richer. That said, at the same time there is a dominant voice or part or part to our attention at any one time. Our agency seems to come from mindfully directing our focus one way or another. (Although in many cases it is rather external stimuli, (e.g. a reminder from an external source or a visual cue) that will lead us to change our behaviour). Under this mindful agency, we will act once we realise 1. We can do something about our goals or values 2. We have decided or clarified what our goals and actions are, and that the action we plan to take meets a required threshold (e.g. this decision will be "good enough").

This form of delberate choosing is quite exhausting, so we rely on it rarely. Instead, we rely on our habits of everyday life with our work, friends, family and hobbies and continue similar patterns.
